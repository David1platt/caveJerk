The stairs end in a small antechamber cut off from the rest of this floor of the dungeon by two heavy ancient doors. Each door takes a great deal of force to open. The hinges creak hideously with such violence that you cringe from the sound. Your presence on this level of the cave system has been announced clearly in no uncertain terms.#south#east#up# #0#0#3#passage way#east#west# # #1#0#3#passage way#east#west# # #2#0#3#passage waypassage waypassage way#west# # # #3#0#3#The tiles on the floor of this room remind you of a chessboard, but there are no pieces to be found.
